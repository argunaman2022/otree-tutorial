HTML COMMENT
1.This is a page that a player sees.
2.To access variables use {{model.field}} e.g. {{player.name}}
    2.a the following variables are available for templates: player,group,subsession,participant,session,C
    2.b any other variables must be passed to the page in the page class with vars_for_template() function.
3. If statements work like this : {{ for item in some_list}}
                                    {{item}}
                                  {{ endfor }}
4. to access dictionaries do {{my_dict.key}} instead of my_dict['key']
6. Note that you cannot do math, any math should be done in a function and be sent via vars_for_template()
7. you can create your own template save it as "template.html" then call it in the page {{template}}
    7.a this html file can contain JS, CSS etc.
    7.b JS and CSS can be used anywhere within the template (the html file) as usual. it's good practice to keep scripts and CSS code in a seperate folder
    7.c to pass data to JS code in template, create a function on the page for instance:
        @staticmethod
        def js_var(player):
            return dict (payoff=player.payoff, a=1)
        then in the template (the html file) you can refer to this as <script>let x= js_vars.payoff</script>
    7.d otree comes with Bootstrap. to use bootstrap for custom style etc. use class= attribute to the html element in the template. e.g:
        <div class="altert alert-success">Great Job!</div>
    7.e for charts use HighCharts see: https://otree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/templates.html#charts
8. To troubleshoot a page do "view source" on page to see the raw HTML with JS and CSS.
9. for customizing Otree using CSS, see selectors at: https://otree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/templates.html#customizing-the-theme
