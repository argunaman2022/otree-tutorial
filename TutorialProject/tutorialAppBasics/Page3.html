{#
1. I created slider_choice field in player and put it in formfields for page3.
    - here i need to write the html code for this since i want it to be a slider
2. ADDITIONALLY I have created a hidden field called "players_slider_choice"
    - I write a JS code to store the choice of the player into this field so that i can access it after the game.
#}

<input type="hidden" name="players_slider_choice" id="players_slider_choice" />

{#
using Django create a slider: see https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/forms/range/
1. first i label the slider
2. second i call an input with class="form-range", make sure to add onchange="somefunction" and define this function to execute when users make a change
3. then when user interracts "myFunction" is called which does the following
    a. get the users choice and store it in hischoice
    b. save this value to the field 'player_slider_choice'
    c. log this value to the console -> inspect element
#}

<label for="slider_choice_django" class="form-label">Example range</label>  {#1#}
<input type="range" class="form-range" min="-10" max="10" step="0.1" id="slider_choice_django" onchange="myFunction()"> {#2.#}

<script>
function myFunction(){
    hischoice=document.getElementById('slider_choice_django').value {#3a#}
    document.getElementById('players_slider_choice').value=hischoice {#3b#}
    console.log(hischoice) {#3c#}
    document.getElementById("hischoice").innerHTML =hischoice {# edits  the p below to display his choice#}
}
</script>




    {# i omit formfields #}
    your choice is: <p id="hischoice">
    {{formfield 'name'}} {#i have to put some field here otherwise i get errors....#}
    {{ next_button }}
