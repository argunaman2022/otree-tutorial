Use bots to test the app
steps:
1. add bots to the app (see below) by creating a tests.py file.
2. in the session config set use_browser_bots=True
3. run the server (devserver) and create a session, as you open the page pages will auto-play with the browser bots


tests.py: (example: https://github.com/oTree-org/oTree/blob/lite/survey/tests.py)
1. need one yield per page submission:
    yield pages.Start #since in start there's no fields to fill
    yield pages.Survey, dict(name="Bob", age=20) #since in Survey page there is the name and age field only
2. use if statements to make sure bots play proper strategies in relevant rounds and for given player.ids:
    if self.round_number == 1: #since the introduction (empty) page is only in the round 1 we need to yield it only here
        yield pages.Introduction
    if self.player.id_in_group == 1: #if bot is assigned id==1 then it should yield in the offer page hif offer, otherwise he doesnt see this page
        yield pages.Offer, dict(offer=30)
    else:
        yield pages.Accept, dict(offer_accepted=True)
3. ignore waitpages when writing bots.
4. Bot codes should be set for only one round. Otree runs this botcode (tests.py) NUM_ROUNDS amount of times. therefore use if self.round_number condition a lot
5. use expect statements to make sure code runs as expected. For instance:
    expect(self.player.num_apples, 100)
    yield pages.Eat, dict(apples_eaten=1)
    expect(self.player.num_apples, 99)
    yield pages.SomeOtherPage
                or
    expect(self.player.budget, '<', 100)
                or
    for value in [self.player.crt_bat, self.player.payoff]:
            expect(value, '!=', None)
    5.a if the expected value isnt matched error is raised.
    5.b for expect the following operators are valid: '<', '<=', '==', '>=', '>', '!=', 'in', 'not in'.
6. if the fields have form validations (i.e. max and min numbers etc) can use SubmissionMustFail() to make sure certain submissions fail.
    when using SubmissionMustFail(page.MyPage, dict(fields)) the bot submits this and expects an error,
    if error isnt raised (i.e. page submission succeeds) bot raises an error. An example:
        yield SubmissionMustFail(pages.Eat, dict(apples_eaten=abs)) #try this in our app.
7. self.html contains the HTML of the page bot's about to submit. can combine self.html with expect('somethingsomething'. 'in', self.html) to make sure certain things are shown in the page
8. bots dont see buttons and fields that are added dynamically with JS, they automatically check the html for such fields and buttons. to fix this use:
    yield Submission(pages.MyPage, dict(foo=99), check_html=False) NOT  yield pages.MyPage, dict(foo=99)
9. See MISC for advanced bots.
