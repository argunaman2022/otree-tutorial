I.APPS:
1.If you want to access a participants data from a previous app you should store it on the participant object, which persists across apps
    1a. in settings, in PARTICIPANT_FIELDS =[a,b] to define a list of fields for the participant
        then in the code __init__.py you can get and set any type of data on these fields participant.a=[1,2,3]
2. Global variables that are same for all participants in the session is added to SESSION_FIELDS in settings.py


II.TREATMENTS:
1. to assign participants to different treatments use creating_session, this is run immediately when you press create session:
    def creating_session(subsession):
        import random
        for player in subsession.get_players():
            player.time_pressure= random.choice([True,False])
            print('set time_pressure to', player.time_pressure)

2. create_session gets executed for each round independently so a player could have different treatment in different rounds.
    to circumvent this set the treatment on participant level not player
        def creating_session(subsession):
            import random
            for player in subsession.get_players():
                participant=player.participant
                participant.time_pressure= random.choice([True,False])
                print('set time_pressure to', participant.time_pressure)

3. note that the code above does treatment assignment randomly, to have a balanced treatment use itertools:
    def creating_subsession(subsession):
        import itertools
        pressures = itertools.cycle([True,False]) # everytime next(pressure) is called it equals true then false then true then false etc.
        for player in subsession.get_players():
            player.time_pressure=next(pressures)

4. Choosing which treatment to play:
    in session_config you can set the treatment to a value to ensure the treatment is always on to develop the app

5. Sessions are configurable i.e. you can have multiple session configs and choose from one when creating a session; see :https://otree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/treatments.html#configure-sessions
