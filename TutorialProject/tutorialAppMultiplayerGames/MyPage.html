    {#a
    chat room for groups
    1. nickname is the nickname with which the player is shown
    2. channel is by default group.id for each player, playes that have the same channel can chat
        2.a default valu being group.id if instead we want thoes with the same role to chat, we set channel=player.id_in_group which ensures only playerXs can talk to each other
        2.b channel=1 would let everyone talk to everyone
    3. you can style the chat by butting it inside a div
    4. multiple chats can be open for participant
    5. chat between experimenter and participant is possible too, see: https://otree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/admin.html#experimenter-chat
